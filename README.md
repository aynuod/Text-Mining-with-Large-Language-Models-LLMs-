# Text Mining with Large Language Models (LLMs)

This repository demonstrates the use of **pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs)** for text mining tasks such as **sentiment analysis**, **text summarization**, and **text generation** using the Hugging Face Transformers library.

## Objectives

- Understand how to apply pretrained LLMs to real-world text mining tasks.
- Perform sentiment analysis to classify text as positive or negative.
- Generate summaries for long text passages using a summarization pipeline.
- Generate creative text using GPT-2, a decoder-based Transformer model.

## Features

1. **Sentiment Analysis**:
   - Classify text as "POSITIVE" or "NEGATIVE".
   - Example: `"I love this product!" → POSITIVE`.

2. **Text Summarization**:
   - Generate concise summaries for lengthy input text.
   - Example: Summarizing a paragraph about Transformer models into a few lines.

3. **Text Generation**:
   - Generate human-like text continuations based on a given prompt.
   - Example: `"Artificial intelligence in healthcare is..." → Full generated text`.
